✅ CSS Types Used:

1. Inline CSS:
   - Applied on the <section> tag to style the profile card directly with:
     background-color (cream), padding, margin, width, border-radius.
     Example: 
     <section style="background-color: #fffdd0; padding: 30px; ...">

2. Internal CSS:
   - Defined in the <style> tag inside <head>.
   - Used for styling:
     - .bio text
     - section titles
     - hr lines
     - hover effect on links
     - layout styling using Flexbox for centering
     - responsive styling for smaller screens

3. External CSS:
   - Linked via <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> (optional based on how much style is split externally).
   - Contains shared styles (if separated into style.css) like font, shadows, background color, or #profile-pic.


✅ CSS Selectors Used:

1. ID Selector:
   - #profile-pic → Makes profile image circular, centered, and styled.

     #profile-pic {
       border-radius: 50%;
       ...
     }

   - .bio → For styling the short bio.
   - .profile-card → For layout and background of the card.
   - .section-title → Used to format headings.

3. Element Selectors:
   - body, h1, h2, ul, li, hr → For general layout and design.
   - a[href] → For hyperlink styling.

4. Group Selector:
   - h1, h2 → Same font-family applied.

5. Descendant Selector:
   - .contact p → Applies margin only to <p> tags inside contact section.

6. Attribute Selector:
   - a[href] → Styles all hyperlinks with consistent color and appearance.
